#### API Documentation : https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16498899/UVJbGHFn

#### Developer Strength : Backend

#### General Questions
1. What informed my choice of technology ? 

Firstly my technology of choice was django, reason being that, fast development was needed to complete this project and django already handles majority of the logic i would have had to think about before implementing in other languages such as security and database related issues and alot more. So i only had to focus on writing the applications logic.

2. What is messaging queue ?

In my understanding a message queue is more for an asynchrounous operation e.g I want to buy food from a cafeteria. My order is collected and other people available orders are collected likewise and we told to wait while it being made or packaged.
It is bascically given a response but not necessariy the required response as at time of call. It would still have to undergo a background work before the actual response is effected.
It is used to offload time consuming tasks.
